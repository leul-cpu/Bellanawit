## 2025-05-14 - Themed Focus Indicators
**Learning:** For dark-themed portfolios with primary accent colors (like gold), using the primary accent color for `focus-visible` outlines provides a high-contrast yet aesthetically integrated navigation experience.

**Learning:** In highly interactive visual interfaces, keyboard users often miss out on "delight" features (like card lift and border reveals) if they are only bound to `:hover`. Mapping these effects to `:focus-visible` ensures that keyboard navigation feels as premium and responsive as mouse interaction.
**Action:** Always extend `:hover` visual effects to `:focus-visible` for key interactive components to maintain accessibility and UX parity.
